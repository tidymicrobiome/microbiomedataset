\title{Global Patterns of 16S rRNA Diversity}
\format{
An object of class \code{microbiome_dataset} with 19216 rows and 26 columns.
}
\usage{
global_patterns
}
\description{
Published in PNAS in early 2011, this dataset compares microbial communities from 25 environmental
samples and three known “mock communities” – a total of 9 sample types – at a depth averaging 3.1
million reads per sample. The study reproduced diversity patterns seen in many other published studies
and investigated technical issues/bias by applying the same techniques to simulated microbial
communities of known composition. This data is from the phyloseq package.
