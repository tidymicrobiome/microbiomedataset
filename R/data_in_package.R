#' @title (Data) Global patterns of 16S rRNA diversity at a depth of millions of sequences per sample (2011)
#'
#'
#' @description Published in PNAS in early 2011. This work compared the microbial
#'  communities from 25 environmental samples and three known “mock communities”
#'   – a total of 9 sample types – at a depth averaging 3.1 million reads per
#'    sample. Authors were able to reproduce diversity patterns seen in many 
#'    other published studies, while also invesitigating technical 
#'    issues/bias by applying the same techniques to simulated microbial 
#'    communities of known composition.
