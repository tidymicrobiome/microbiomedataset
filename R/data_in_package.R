#' Global Patterns of 16S rRNA Diversity
#'
#' Published in PNAS in early 2011, this dataset compares microbial communities from 25 environmental 
#' samples and three known “mock communities” – a total of 9 sample types – at a depth averaging 3.1 
#' million reads per sample. The study reproduced diversity patterns seen in many other published studies 
#' and investigated technical issues/bias by applying the same techniques to simulated microbial 
#' communities of known composition. This data is from the phyloseq package.
